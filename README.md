# canvas_scroll
Image Scroller in canvas element

The Task

Implement an image slider like the example above, that lets you drag to change images. It should work exactly like the example provided, unless you think there is a bug (this is not a trick question - there shouldn't be any bugs but mistakes happen). In addition to that, the requirements are:

- the slider should be rendered in a single canvas element.
- there should be at least 3 images and they shouldn't all have the same dimensions (feel free to use the images provided here).
- you can use any language that compiles to JavaScript and any libraries or framework you like.
- the slider doesn't have to work on all browsers as long as it works on the latest webkit or gecko browsers (please indicate which).
